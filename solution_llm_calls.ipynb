It is divisible by 4.\\n2.  **Unless** it is divisible by 100.\\n3.  **Unless** it is divisible by 400. (So, years divisible by 400 *are* leap years, even though they are divisible by 100).\\n\\nIn simpler terms:\\n*   If a year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year. (e.g., 2000, 2400)\\n*   If a year is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it is NOT a leap year. (e.g., 1900, 2100)\\n*   If a year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, it IS a leap year. (e.g., 2024, 2028)\\n*   Otherwise, it is NOT a leap year. (e.g., 2023, 2025)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Python Implementation\\n\\n```python\\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Checks if a given year is a leap year according to the Gregorian calendar rules.\\n\\n    A leap year is defined as:\\n    - A year that is evenly divisible by 4.\\n    - EXCEPT for years that are evenly divisible by 100.\\n    - UNLESS the year is also evenly divisible by 400.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        year: An integer representing the year to check.\\n\\n    Returns:\\n        True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    # Rule 3: Divisible by 400 (e.g., 2000, 2400)\\n    if year % 400 == 0:\\n        return True\\n    # Rule 2: Divisible by 100 but not by 400 (e.g., 1900, 2100)\\n    elif year % 100 == 0:\\n        return False\\n    # Rule 1: Divisible by 4 but not by 100 (e.g., 2024, 2028)\\n    elif year % 4 == 0:\\n        return True\\n    # Otherwise, not a leap year (e.g., 2023, 2025)\\n    else:\\n        return False\\n\\n# --- More concise version using logical operators ---\\ndef is_leap_year_concise(year: int) -> bool:\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Checks if a given year is a leap year using a concise logical expression.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    return (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0)\\n\\n# --- Example Usage ---\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    print(\"--- Using detailed function ---\")\\n    print(f\"Is 2000 a leap year? {is_leap_year(2000)}\")  # Expected: True (divisible by 400)\\n    print(f\"Is 1900 a leap year? {is_leap_year(1900)}\")  # Expected: False (divisible by 100, not 400)\\n    print(f\"Is 2024 a leap year? {is_leap_year(2024)}\")  # Expected: True (divisible by 4, not 100)\\n    print(f\"Is 2023 a leap year? {is_leap_year(2023)}\")  # Expected: False (not divisible by 4)\\n    print(f\"Is 1600 a leap year? {is_leap_year(1600)}\")  # Expected: True\\n    print(f\"Is 2100 a leap year? {is_leap_year(2100)}\")  # Expected: False\\n\\n    print(\"\\\\n--- Using concise function ---\")\\n    print(f\"Is 2000 a leap year? {is_leap_year_concise(2000)}\")\\n    print(f\"Is 1900 a leap year? {is_leap_year_concise(1900)}\")\\n    print(f\"Is 2024 a leap year? {is_leap_year_concise(2024)}\")\\n    print(f\"Is 2023 a leap year? {is_leap_year_concise(2023)}\")\\n    print(f\"Is 1600 a leap year? {is_leap_year_concise(1600)}\")\\n    print(f\"Is 2100 a leap year? {is_leap_year_concise(2100)}\")\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Explanation\\n\\n1.  **`is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:`**\\n    *   This function takes an integer `year` as input.\\n    *   It uses a series of `if/elif/else` statements to apply the leap year rules in a specific order:\\n        *   It first checks the most specific rule: if the year is divisible by 400 (`year % 400 == 0`). If it is, it\\'s a leap year.\\n        *   If not divisible by 400, it then checks if it\\'s divisible by 100 (`year % 100 == 0`). If it is, but *not* by 400 (which was checked first), then it\\'s NOT a leap year.\\n        *   If not divisible by 100 (and thus not by 400 either), it finally checks if it\\'s divisible by 4 (`year % 4 == 0`). If it is, it\\'s a leap year.\\n        *   If none of the above conditions are met, it\\'s not a leap year.\\n\\n2.  **`is_leap_year_concise(year: int) -> bool:`**\\n    *   This function uses a single boolean expression that combines all the rules with logical operators (`and`, `or`).\\n    *   `(year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0)`: This part captures years divisible by 4 but not by 100 (e.g., 2024).\\n    *   `(year % 400 == 0)`: This part captures years divisible by 400 (e.g., 2000).\\n    *   The `or` operator ensures that if *either* of these conditions is true, the year is a leap year. This elegantly handles all the rules in one line. This is generally preferred for its brevity and efficiency.\\n\\nBoth functions yield the same correct results. The concise version is typically favored by experienced Python developers for its readability and elegance once the underlying logic is understood.'"

      "\"Ah, 'Sous le Sable', cooking under the sand, a technique that dates back to the ancient Greeks and Romans! It's a method that requires patience, finesse, and a deep understanding of the nuances of lamb. You see, we bury the lamb, typically a leg or shoulder, in a pit lined with aromatic herbs and sometimes, a few embers. The lamb is then covered with a layer of sand, and left to cook slowly, using the earth's natural heat to tenderize the meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result, my friend, is nothing short of magical. The lamb is infused with the subtle flavors of the herbs and the earthy undertones of the sand, while the slow cooking process breaks down the connective tissues, yielding a tender, almost fall-off-the-bone texture. It's a true delight, and one that I like to serve with a drizzle of our house-made jus and a side of roasted root vegetables.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, of course, 'Sous le Sable' is not just about throwing some lamb in a hole and covering it with sand. No, no, no! It's an art that requires precision, attention to detail, and a deep respect for the ingredients. The temperature, the humidity, the type of sand used – all these factors come into play to create a truly unforgettable dining experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recall a particularly memorable service where we served 'Sous le Sable' lamb to a table of discerning gourmands. The feedback was overwhelming – the lamb was tender, flavorful, and presented with a certain... I don't know, a certain je ne sais quoi that elevated the dish to new heights. It was a true testament to the power of this ancient technique, and a reminder that, sometimes, the most innovative cuisine is rooted in tradition.\"\n"
